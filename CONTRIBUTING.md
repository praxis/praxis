## CONTRIBUTING

We welcome community contributions to make Praxis a better web framework. Here is a list of the great [folks who have helped](https://github.com/rightscale/praxis/graphs/contributors) improve Praxis.

Before submitting any contributions, please read the below description of what the problems Praxis aims to solve. Contributions that are not aligned with Praxis's goals will not be accepted.

### What Praxis is and is NOT

Praxis is a web framework for...

* developing REST-style APIs for [SOA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) systems.
* establishing conventions for consistency in API development.
* developing self-documenting API resources.
* generating documentation solely from Ruby code that is actually run and enforced.

Praxis is **NOT**...

* a Rails plugin or extension. *(If you wish to use Praxis with Rails, please develop it as a separate gem or equivalent. We will not enhance Praxis with Rails-specific functionality.)*
* a web framework for serving UI front-ends. *(Although web front-end UIs can certainly be backed by Praxis apps)*
