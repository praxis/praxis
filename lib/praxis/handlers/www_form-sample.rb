# This is an example of a handler that can load and generate www-url-encoded payloads.
# Note that if you use your API to pass nil values for attributes as a way to unset their 
# values, this handler will not work (as there isn't necessarily a defined "null" value in 
# this encoding (although you can probably define how to encode/decode it and use it as such)
# Use at your own risk.
